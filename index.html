									<h2>My Story :)</h2>
									<p>I earned my BSc Psychology with Economics degree at The University of Sussex in May 2023. <br> For my dissertation project, I investigated the effects of varying levels of parental engagement on children's school outcomes. I used R to create linear regression models and applied statistical techniques to identify key insights. </p>
                                    
                                    <p> After graduation, I took the initiative to enroll in the DataCamp Data Analyst R course, where I have been improving my knowledge and skills. Some projects I have worked on include visualizing inequalities in life expectancy across countries and genders using data from 1985-2005 with R. I plan on doing projects that also utilise some machine learning in the future. </p>
                                    
                                    <p> I am also part of the HeadStarter AI 7-week summer fellowship, where I will be building 5+ AI apps and APIs using NextJS, OpenAI, Pinecone, and HTML/CSS. I'm particularly excited about learning AI engineering and believe it pairs well with data science skills. </p>
                                    
                                    <p> Outside of this, I currently work at H&M and enjoy going to the gym. If you love trying different food, you can count me in :)) </p>

									<h3>Research Dissertation University of Sussex May 2023</h3>
									<p>Conducted research and analysis of data from the UCL Millennium Cohort Study of 13,000 families to determine how parental engagement impacts children's school outcomes.We created multiple linear regression models using R to throughly analyse the data and test our hypothesis.<br> <br>We found that higher levels of parental interest in their children's education have a positive impact on children's likelihood of attending university and successfully transitioning from primary to secondary school.
